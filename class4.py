#Arithmetic operators(+,-,*,/,//,**,%) #they only work for  numbers datatype

a=12
b=34
#print(a+b) -> addition #46
#print(a-b) -> substraction #-22
#print(a*b) -> multiplication #408
#print(a/b) -> division #0.35294117647058826 (/ gives the answer in manner of Float)
#print(a//b) -> division #0 (// they gives the ans. in integer term)
#print(5 ** 2) -> power operator # 25 (5^2 = 25)
#print(5%2) -> modulo operator # 1 (% they give the answer as remainder)

#IMP:- we use BODMAS rule

#Task 1 :-
print((12+35)/35)


#Assignment operators :-

a = 12
a = a+12 #(reassign   (ANS #24))

a+=12 #(short hand operation)
#examples :- += ,-= ,*=,/=,//=,%= 

#strings also use some operatores like 
# + for concatenation

a ="hello"
b= " brother"

print(a+b) 

#some extra things :-
print("hello" + 3) # showing error because we concatente  strings only with strings

print("hello"*3) # prints hello 3 times or as much as you can depends on you
